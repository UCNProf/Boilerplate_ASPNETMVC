# Boilerplate ASP.NET MVC
This is a sample implementation of a simple ASP.NET MVC application. The application is documented using `markdown` files in each folder, where there is explanation necessary. There are several important parts that this project highlights:

* The difference between DTO and domain entities
* The usage of DTO and Request objects
* The location of the client and how the client communicates with the backend

## A CRM system
This boilerplate implementation will be a simple Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System. A system like this enables a company to keep track of all of their customers.
